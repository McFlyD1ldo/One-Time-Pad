# One Time Pad
The one time pad is a very simple encryption algorithm that is still incredibly safe.
To use it you have to provide the data that has to be encrypted and a file of your choice to use as a key. The key has to be atleast as big as your file or bigger.
The key is used to encrypt your data a single time through an xor. Now your data can only be correctly decrypted using this key.

The load from file button opens two dialogues where the first loaded file is your data and the second your key. Then you can encrypt/decrypt it and use the save to file button, to choose a saving location.

Enjoy!
